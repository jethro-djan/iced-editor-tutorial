This is a tutorial explaining the YouTube video ([]()] by @hecrj on how to create minimal editor using [iced.rs](). 

[iced.rs]() is a GUI library that allows you to utilise [MVU or Elm Architecture]() to make GUI apps in the Rust language. You would normally find this way of architecting GUIs common with functional languages like Elm and F#. But the same architecture can be leveraged to make GUI apps because Rust can provide the same guarantees the architecture relies on in functional languages (immutability and referencial transparency). For more information on getting started with this library, head over to [Getting started - iced.rs]().
